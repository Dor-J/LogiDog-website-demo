# Implement Delay Logic

> Write a small code snippet (in any language of your choice) that:

    1. Defines a function (e.g., isShipmentAtRisk(shipmentData)).
    2. Function should take a single shipment object
    3. Implement your proposed logic from Section 1 (e.g., "If deliveryDate is within X days AND currentStage is not Y")
    to determine if the shipment is at risk of delay
    4. Function should return true if the shipment is at risk, and false otherwise
    5. Provide example calls to this function with 2-3 different shipment objects from
    your sample data, demonstrating both "at risk" and "not at risk" scenarios, and print the results.
