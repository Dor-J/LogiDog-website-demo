# In-Depth Problem Understanding and Logical Solution Proposal

> Analysis of Delay Factors: Briefly describe the common and potential causes of shipment delays for a logistics company of this scale.
> Focus on both operational factors and external factors.

    My root cause analysis:
        1. why are there delay in shipment?
            Shipment can get delayed by:
            a. It is stuck in origin country due to regulation or lack of staff to handle shipment .
            b. The shipment is delayed on it's way due to: weather, sea traffic etc.
            c. shipment arrived to country but its stalled before customs due to problems like the port being too crowded or by local logistic staffing problems.
            d. shipment arrived and is delayed at custom for either a regular examinatnion or it is detained or lacks documentation.
            e. shimpment has left customs and now is transported on land and is delayed by land transportation reasons like bad weather, lack of enough tranporters trucks
        2. Dividing the problems operational factors and external factors in a table

| Stage                  | Operational factors              | External factors        |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------------- | :---------------------- |
| Pre-shipment           | Lack of staff to handle shipment | Regulation              |
| During shipment        | Sea traffic                      | Bad weather             |
| Arrival pre-customs    | Local logistic staffing problems | Port being too crowded  |
| At customs             | Lacks of documentation           | Regular examinatnion    |
| Transport post-customs | Lack of enough tranporters       | Bad weather             |
| Local land Transport   |                                  | Long distance from port |

> Early Delay Identification Logic: Present a simple flowchart or a clear textual
> description outlining your proposed logic for early delay identification.
> (For example: "If the delivery date is within X upcoming days, and the shipment is
> still in stage Y, then trigger an alert.")

> What types of data (existing or to be collected) could serve as
> strong indicators for accurate delay prediction? Explain the
> rationale for each data type.

> Considering a future implementation of a Machine Learning
> (ML) model: Which existing data fields, or fields that need to be
> specifically collected, would be critical for training such a model?
> Explain why

> Alert Triggering Approach: Would you prefer alerts to be
> triggered by rule-based mechanisms or dynamic analysis (e.g.,
> a basic statistical/ML model)? Explain the advantages and
> disadvantages of each approach in the context of this initial
> logistics system, and justify your choice.
