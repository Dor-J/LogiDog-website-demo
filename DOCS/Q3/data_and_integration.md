# Sample Data and Integration

> Fictitious Data Creation: Create a data table (JSON or SQL table(s)) for at least
> 15 sample shipments, where some exhibit potential "delay" scenarios that align
> with your created logic and design. Ensure all fields defined in your screen
> design are included.

    Used src\utils\generateShipments.ts script to generate the shipments with different stages, some with delay indicators (e.g., customs detain, late actual dates).

    The data is use in the Dashbpard page and as a json file in this folder

> API Design: Please design an API that will serve the client. Focus on input and
> output format and communication protocol.
