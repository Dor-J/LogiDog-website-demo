# Sample Data and Integration

> Fictitious Data Creation: Create a data table (JSON or SQL table(s)) for at least
> 15 sample shipments, where some exhibit potential "delay" scenarios that align
> with your created logic and design. Ensure all fields defined in your screen
> design are included.

> API Design: Please design an API that will serve the client. Focus on input and
> output format and communication protocol.
